# signal_neural_net
Deep Neural Network based Q factor analysis. 

## Intro
This uses a DNN to determine an event-by-event weight on whether a given event is signal or background. 
It uses a mixture of different kinematic variables and extracts correlations between a reference coordinate and the non-reference coordinates.
